   PLUGIN USAGE
==================

installation:
make
make install


There are a number of commands for getting information from this
plugin.  They are designed to be tacked onto a URL, but can also be
sent directly via a network socket. The commands are similar to the
txtinfo plugin, but not exactly the same.

If there is no command or no recognized command, then it sends the
/status output, which is the combination of /neighbors, /links,
/routes, /hna, /mid, /topology, /gateways, and /interfaces.

grouped information:
* /all - all of the data in JSON format
* /runtime - all of the data that reflects the runtime status of olsrd and the mesh
* /startup - all of the data about the startup configuration

runtime information:
* /neighbors (including 2-hop)
* /links
* /routes
* /hna
* /mid
* /topology
* /gateways
* /interfaces
* /status - data that changes during runtime (all above commands combined)

start-up information:
* /config - the current configuration, i.e. what was loaded from the olsrd.conf
* /plugins - currently loaded plugins and their config parameters

start-up information not in JSON format:
* /olsrd.conf - the current config, formatted for writing directly to /etc/olsrd.conf


   PLUGIN CONFIGURATION
==========================

The plugin accepts two parameters: "port" and "accept". There are no
futher parameters.  Here's an example configuration for UNIX systems
(for Windows, change the plugin to end in .dll):

LoadPlugin "olsrd_jsoninfo.so.0.1"
{
    # the default port is 9090 but you can change it like this:
    #PlParam     "port"   "8080"

    # You can set a "accept" single address to allow to connect to
    # jsoninfo. If no address is specified, then localhost (127.0.0.1)
    # is allowed by default.  jsoninfo will only use the first "accept"
    # parameter specified and will ignore the rest.

    # to allow a specific host:
    #PlParam      "accept" "172.29.44.23"
    # if you set it to 0.0.0.0, it will accept all connections
    #PlParam      "accept" "0.0.0.0"
}
