olsrd (0.4.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * fix debian/copyright (gui/linux-gtk is GPL licenced, not BSD like the rest)
  * upgraded debian/compat debhelper source-depends version to 5 (as it's enough 
    if 0.4.10-1 builds on sarge without changes)
  * use ${binary:Version} format for olsrd-plugins depends on olsrd, for the
    same reason
